Simulation of a set of rectilinear an uniform movements.

Here we have some basics vector 3d algebra implementation.

1. Sum of vectors
2. Scalar by a vector.
3. Scalar product for two vectors.

Movile has an identification a 3 vectors for its dinamycs.

1. Position,
2. Velocity.
3. Orientation.


TODOS:

-Setting up an arbitray quantity of moviles from file.
-Runing a simulation updatingof every movile.
-Report the trajectory of every single movile.
